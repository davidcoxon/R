## about david coxon 

Hi I’m David Coxon, I live in the North East of England and work as Head of IT at the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art. R was the first statistical analysis package that I studied back in 2015.

I took the John Hopkins Mooc on Coursera, and created several projects to explore, analyse and visualise data.

## about projects

My first project looked at the shopping habits of Gallery visitors in BALTIC’s award winning Store. Comparing the footfall from the main enterance of the Gallery to footfall within the store, looking at factors like time of day and day of the week.
This resulted in the identification of periods where shoppers were more likely to purchase and others were they were more likely to simply browse. Further analysis lead to adapting sales behaviour and removal of barriers to conversion. 

Other projects involved trying to predict programme sales for the  Newcastle Theatre Royal by generating linear regressions by genre, during performance date, local castings and run duration as features.

## upcoming projects

I am currently studying Python for DataScience with [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), I hope to complete the course in Spring 2018 and to go on to study a nano degree on Udacity.
I currently have no plans to work on R projects in 2018.

There is a Data Science group starting in the North East in 2018, so its possible I will return to working with R in the future to collaborate on R projects, which would be posted here.
